# Shimmy Governance

Shimmy is maintained by its original author.

The core project is open-source and welcomes issues, discussion, and contributions.
Major architectural or licensing decisions are made to preserve:
- openness of the core engine
- long-term sustainability of the project
- safety for users embedding Shimmy in production systems
